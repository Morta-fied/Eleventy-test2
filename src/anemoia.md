  <h1>Anemoia: Music Streaming Service</h1>
  <p>In my multimedia programming and design class, to practice making cards in Figma, we were asked to choose between a movie streaming sight ir a music one. I chose music. The site i designed is called Anemoia. Anemoia means nostalgia for a time you've never known. It is a site for younger generations to enjoy, 70s, 80s, and 90s music.  </p>
