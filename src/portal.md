  <h1>Nostalgia Portal: For 80s and 90s Enthusiasts</h1>
  <p> My MMP 200 class really opened my eyes to web and UI/UX design. For our mid term, we were asked to create a site around our personal interests. I had actually been thinking about this site for a while. I am a huge 1980s and 1990s pop culture fan and during the pandemic, I tried to find clubs on social media with this same interest. The only place I could find any was on Facebook. I wanted to create a site where enthusiasts could purchase memorabilia, stream music and movies and chat! That's what The Nostalgia Portal is. A place for the super fans to endulge and share their expereince with other super fans.
